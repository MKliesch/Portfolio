## PsychoPy Tests for the Assessment of Cognitive Performance
* 5 cognitive tests (alertness, divided attention, go/no-go, n-back, operation span) adopted from previous studies to assess cognitive performance in older learners (see Kliesch & Pfenninger, in review).
* Tech: [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/) (Builder and Coder view)

## ML Project:  SVM and Decision Trees to Identify Cancer in Human Cell Samples
* Dataset of 700 cell samples and 10 cell characteristics used as predictors of cell state (benign/malignant).
* SVM and DT are used to predict cell type and compared in terms of 5 performance measures.
* Tech: Python
